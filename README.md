// WARNING BEFORE CONTINUE //

If u read this, it is my first official Portfolio. First time that I apply Responsive on a website so be understanding, this is the first time that I formalize a project on the platform and that it will be seen by many users. 

This portfolio consists of a single page, I hesitated for a long time to split it into several pages but I think that aesthetically it is better to do it on a single page. (Do not hesitate to give me a constructive opinion if something is not well applied or other, I begin to apply my knowledge that I have been able to acquire!)

Some bugs may escape my hands so if you find some bugs, please support at pierre.legouix76@gmail.com!

See u next one ;p
